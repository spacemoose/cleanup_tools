* What is this?

  Sometimes I write little refactoring tools to help me with a
  concrete problem.  They aren't really awesome, but they might be
  useful to someone, or at least to me at a later date.

** modernize_headers
   in the modernize_headers folder you can build a little C++ progrma
   that replaces stuff like:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
 #ifndef some-identifier
 #define some-identifier
     /// code.
#endif
#+END_SRC

with the vastly better:

#+BEGIN_SRC C++
#pragma once
// code
#+END_SRC

** standardizel.pl
   A little perl script to fix code where developers have used "using
   namespace std" inside their header files.
** cute_to_boost.pl
   A little perl script that turns a cute unit test into a boost unit
   test.
